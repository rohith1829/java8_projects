# Java 8 Stream API Practice Problems ‚òïüöÄ

This repository contains a series of hands-on exercises and solutions for mastering the **Java 8 Stream API** and the **Optional class**. The problems are designed to build a strong practical understanding of both intermediate and terminal stream operations, as well as safe data handling with `Optional`.

---

## 1. Problem Statements

The assignments are divided into three main sections:

### a) Intermediate Operations
These problems focus on building a stream pipeline with operations that return a new stream.
1.  **Filter**: Find all numbers greater than 50 in a list.
2.  **Map**: Convert a list of strings to a list of their lengths.
3.  **Sorted**: Sort a list of names in ascending order.
4.  **Distinct**: Return only the unique values from a list of integers.
5.  **Limit & Skip**: Get the first 3 even numbers after skipping the first 2 elements.
6.  **Peek**: Debug a stream by printing elements after a filtering operation.

### b) Terminal Operations
These problems focus on operations that produce a result or a side-effect, terminating the stream.
1.  **forEach**: Print all elements of a list.
2.  **collect**: Convert a list of integers into a set.
3.  **reduce**: Find the product of all numbers in a list.
4.  **count**: Count names in a list that start with "A".
5.  **min & max**: Find the maximum salary from a list of employee objects.
6.  **anyMatch / allMatch / noneMatch**: Perform various boolean checks on student scores.
7.  **findFirst / findAny**: Find the first string longer than 5 characters.

### c) Optional Class
These problems focus on safely handling potentially null values using the `Optional` class.
1.  **`Optional` Creation**: Return an `Optional` for a username, handling null cases.
2.  **`orElse()`**: Provide a default value for a null email.
3.  **`orElseThrow()`**: Throw an exception if a value is missing.
4.  **`map()`**: Safely convert a string to uppercase.
5.  **Combined Problem**: Multiply a value by 2 if present in an `Optional`.
6.  **`findStudentById()`**: Return an `Optional` and use `ifPresent()` to print details only if the student is found.

## 2. Combined Problem Statements (Streams + Optional)

These are more complex, scenario-based problems that combine both the Stream API and the Optional class.
* **Library Management**: Filter, sort, and find the most expensive book from a list of `Book` objects.
* **Employee Performance System**: Filter employees by department and salary, and find the highest-paid employee.
* **Student Result Processing**: Find a student by name, check pass status for all students, and calculate the average score.
* **E-commerce Orders**: Filter orders by total amount and status, and find unique statuses.
* **Movie Ratings System**: Filter movies by rating and genre, and find the highest-rated movie.
* **Banking Transactions**: Filter transactions by type and amount, find the total sum, and retrieve the first credit transaction.

## 3. Test Case List üß™

Each problem has a corresponding set of test cases to ensure the solution is correct and handles edge cases appropriately.

* **TC1:** Filter and sort books with a price over 500.
* **TC2:** Extract a list of unique authors.
* **TC3:** Find the most expensive book using `Optional`.
* **TC4:** Test the edge case of an empty book list.
* **TC5:** Test the edge case of multiple employees with the same maximum salary.

*(Note: The full list of test cases is detailed in the project's test files.)*
